                This application aims to reduce the time and cost of presenting work
                for an external program review. Open source technologies are used 
                throughout to maintain low cost, and ensure that the system can be 
                maintained and customized without impediment. Presentation output
                formats are designed to be device agnostic where possible.
            </p>
            <h2>Archive Schema</h2>
            <p>
                The work archive is organized entirely in the file system, to make it as
                accessible and easy to work with as possible. It doesn't matter what
                platform you are on, or what specific file system is used. As long as this
                application is able to access and read that file system, then it should be
                able to work.
            </p>
            <p>
                The archive follows a convention that, when followed, allows the system to
                automatically parse and translate content for presentation. The	convention
                is as follows: Somewhere on your computer or on your network, you will
                define a folder that will contain all of your archive content. This is called
                the <code>ARCHIVE_ROOT</code>. Inside of
                that folder you will create one folder for each course that you need to present.
                In turn, each course folder will contain the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A file called course_description.txt</li>
                <li>An optional file called course_description.pdf, with course description in a formatted presentation.</li>
                <li>A folder for each assignment</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Each assignment folder must have the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each assignment must have assignment_description.txt, and an optional assignment_description.pdf</li>
                <li>All student work files</li>
                <li>Each assignment must have assignment_description.txt, and an optional assignment_description.pdf</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Once you've built this structure, your file system should look something like this:
            </p>
<pre>
+- My Archive Folder
   |
   +- Course Folder 1 - Introduction to Construction
      |- course_description.txt
      |- course_description.pdf
      +- Assignment Folder 1 - Orthographic Drawing
         - assignment_description.txt
         - files.xls
         - ...student work files...
      +- Assignment Folder X
         ...
    +- Course Folder X
        ...
</pre>

            <h3>Supported Media Formats</h3>
            <p>
                    The media types noted in the table below are supported for student work
                    files. Text and Excel XLS files are supported for metadata files. Other files
                    will be flagged by the system, to give you an opportunity to manually convert 
                    them to a useable format.
            </p>
          <table id="formats">
            <tr><th>Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Comments</th></tr>
            <tr><td>bmp</td><td>Bitmap</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>

            <h3>QR Codes for Physical Artifacts</h3>
            <p>
                If you want to present physical artifacts in your exhibition, the system can
                    generate a a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code">QR Code</a> for each
                    item.  You can print out the barcodes on a standard Avery label sheet, and then
                    attach them to the respective items. The QRCode embeds a URL that will enable the 
                    reviewer to retreive data about the artifact, using a mobile device.
            </p>
            <p>
                    A unique identitifying code is created for each digital file, using an MD5
                    hash of the file. To keep the QR code relatively simple so that it can be
                    read from a distance, a 32 bit hash code is used as the identifier.
            </p>
