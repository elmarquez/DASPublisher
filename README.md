DAS Publisher
-------------

For architecture schools undertaking a periodic program review, DASPub can 
dramatically reduce the time, human labor and cost of producing a digital 
presentation of the school's work.  Similarly, for reviewers, the mobile, 
physical and static digital interfaces do much to reduce the tedious process of
locating and assessing presented content.

DASPub is a command line utility that can convert a simple file system based
archive into a variety of presentations, for viewing on 

* Mobile phone, tablet and desktop devices
* Supports tagging and look-up of physical artifacts 
* QR Code tagging for all digital artifacts
* Interactive or automatic slideshow
